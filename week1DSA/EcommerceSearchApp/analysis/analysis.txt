1. Understand Asymptotic Notation:
Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of input size. It helps analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms, providing a way to compare their performance.

Best-case scenario: The algorithm performs the least number of operations (e.g., finding the target element at the first position in a search).
Average-case scenario: The algorithm performs a moderate number of operations (e.g., finding the target element somewhere in the middle).
Worst-case scenario: The algorithm performs the maximum number of operations (e.g., searching through the entire array without finding the target).

2. Setup:
The Product class is created with attributes productId, productName, and category to facilitate searching operations.

3. Implementation:
Linear Search:
- Linear search iterates through each element in the array to find the target.
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

Binary Search:
- Binary search works on sorted arrays by dividing the search space in half at each step.
- Time complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

Products are stored in an array for linear search and a sorted array for binary search.

4. Analysis:
Comparison:
- Linear search is simpler and does not require the array to be sorted, but it is slower for large datasets.
- Binary search is faster due to its logarithmic time complexity but requires the array to be sorted beforehand.

Suitability:
- For small datasets or unsorted arrays, linear search is more suitable due to its simplicity.
- For large datasets or sorted arrays, binary search is more efficient and preferable.

Conclusion:
Binary search is generally more suitable for platforms where performance is critical and data can be pre-sorted. Linear search is better for smaller datasets or when sorting is not feasible.
